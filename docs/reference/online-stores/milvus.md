# Milvus online store

## Description

The [Milvus](https://milvus.io/) online store provides support for materializing feature values into Milvus.

* The data model used to store feature values in Milvus is described in more detail [here](../../specs/online\_store\_format.md).

## Getting started
In order to use this online store, you'll need to install the Milvus extra (along with the dependency needed for the offline store of choice). E.g.

`pip install 'feast[milvus]'`

**Upgrading to milvus-lite 3.0.0+**

Feast supports both milvus-lite 2.x and 3.x. However, if you upgrade from milvus-lite 2.x.x to 3.0.0+, the `.db` files created by the original storage format are **not compatible** with the milvus-lite 3.0.0+ engine. You will need to re-import your data into a new database — automatic migration is not available.

See the [milvus-lite GitHub page](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus-lite) for more details.
{% endhint %}

You can get started by using any of the other templates (e.g. `feast init -t gcp` or `feast init -t snowflake` or `feast init -t aws`), and then swapping in Milvus as the online store as seen below in the examples.

## Examples

Using Milvus Lite, which stores data in a local file:

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: my_feature_repo
registry: data/registry.db
provider: local
online_store:
  type: milvus
  path: "data/online_store.db"
  embedding_dim: 128
  index_type: "FLAT"
  metric_type: "COSINE"
```
{% endcode %}

Connecting to a self-hosted Milvus server:

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: my_feature_repo
registry: data/registry.db
provider: local
online_store:
  type: milvus
  host: "http://localhost"
  port: 19530
  username: "username"
  password: "password"
  embedding_dim: 128
  index_type: "IVF_FLAT"
  metric_type: "COSINE"
```
{% endcode %}

Connecting to [Zilliz Cloud](https://zilliz.com/cloud) (managed Milvus) with an API key.
Read the token from an environment variable rather than committing it:

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: my_feature_repo
registry: data/registry.db
provider: local
online_store:
  type: milvus
  uri: "https://<your-cluster-endpoint>"   # Public Endpoint from the Zilliz Cloud console
  token: ${ZILLIZ_TOKEN}   # pragma: allowlist secret
  db_name: "default"
  embedding_dim: 768
  index_type: "AUTOINDEX"
  metric_type: "COSINE"
```
{% endcode %}

## Configuration options

| Option | Default | Description |
|:-------|:--------|:------------|
| `path` | `""` | Path to a Milvus Lite database file. Used when `provider: local` and `path` is set. |
| `host` | `http://localhost` | Milvus server host, including the scheme. |
| `port` | `19530` | Milvus server port. |
| `uri` | unset | Full endpoint, e.g. `https://<cluster>.zillizcloud.com:19530`. Takes precedence over `host`/`port`, and over `path`. |
| `username` / `password` | `""` | Credentials, sent as the token `username:password`. |
| `token` | unset | API key or `username:password`. Takes precedence over `username`/`password`. |
| `db_name` | unset | Milvus database to use. The database must already exist. Defaults to the server's `default` database. |
| `embedding_dim` | `128` | Dimension of vector fields. |
| `index_type` | `FLAT` | Index type for vector fields with `vector_index=True`. |
| `metric_type` | `COSINE` | Default metric when a field does not set `vector_search_metric`. |
| `nlist` | `128` | `nlist` index parameter, used when `index_params` is unset. |
| `index_params` | unset | Index build parameters passed to Milvus, e.g. `{M: 16, efConstruction: 200}` for HNSW. Defaults to `{nlist: <nlist>}`, or no parameters for `AUTOINDEX`. |
| `search_params` | unset | Search parameters passed to Milvus, e.g. `{ef: 64}` for HNSW or `{level: 2}` for `AUTOINDEX`. Defaults to `{nprobe: 10}`, or no parameters for `AUTOINDEX`. |
| `consistency_level` | unset | `Strong`, `Bounded`, `Session` or `Eventually`. Applied when collections are created and on every read and search. When unset, Milvus uses its default (`Bounded`). |
| `partition_key` | unset | Field to use as the Milvus partition key in feature views that contain it. See [Partition key](#partition-key). |
| `full_text_search` | `false` | Use Milvus BM25 full-text search for `query_string`. See [Full-text search](#full-text-search). |
| `text_analyzer_params` | `{type: standard}` | Analyzer for full-text fields, e.g. `{type: english}` or `{tokenizer: icu}`. |
| `hybrid_ranker` | `rrf` | How to combine vector and full-text results: `rrf` or `weighted`. |
| `hybrid_ranker_params` | unset | Ranker parameters, e.g. `{k: 60}` for `rrf` or `{weights: [0.7, 0.3]}` for `weighted`. |
| `vector_enabled` | `true` | Enables vector search. |
| `varchar_max_length` | `65535` | Default `max_length` of VARCHAR fields. Override per field with the `max_length` tag. |
| `native_numeric_types` | `false` | Store numeric and bool features as native Milvus types. See [Numeric types](#numeric-types). |
| `enable_openai_compatible_store` | `false` | Feast's cross-store flag for native numeric storage (see [vector database docs](../alpha-vector-database.md)). Same effect as `native_numeric_types`. |

The full set of configuration options is available in [MilvusOnlineStoreConfig](https://rtd.feast.dev/en/latest/#feast.infra.online_stores.milvus.MilvusOnlineStoreConfig).

## Index and search parameters

`index_type`, `index_params` and `search_params` are passed through to Milvus, so any index type the
server supports can be used. On Zilliz Cloud, `AUTOINDEX` is recommended; tune the recall/latency
trade-off with the `level` search parameter:

```yaml
online_store:
  type: milvus
  index_type: "AUTOINDEX"
  search_params:
    level: 2
```

For HNSW:

```yaml
online_store:
  type: milvus
  index_type: "HNSW"
  index_params:
    M: 16
    efConstruction: 200
  search_params:
    ef: 64
```

Index parameters only apply when Feast creates a collection. To change them for an existing
collection, run `feast teardown` and `feast apply`, then materialize again.

## Full-text search

By default, `query_string` searches use `LIKE '%query%'` filters on String features, which match
substrings and don't rank results. With `full_text_search: true`, Feast uses Milvus
[full-text search](https://milvus.io/docs/full-text-search.md) instead: each String feature gets an
analyzer and a BM25 function that writes to a sparse `<feature>__bm25` field, and `query_string`
searches rank documents by BM25 score.

```yaml
online_store:
  type: milvus
  full_text_search: true
  text_analyzer_params:
    type: english         # or {tokenizer: icu} for multilingual text
```

The default `standard` analyzer suits most languages that separate words with spaces. Use a
language-specific analyzer such as `{type: english}` for stemming and stop words, or
`{tokenizer: icu}` for multilingual text. See [Milvus analyzers](https://milvus.io/docs/analyzer-overview.md).
Milvus Lite only supports the `standard` and `jieba` tokenizers.

To index only some String features, tag them:

```python
Field(name="title", dtype=String, tags={"milvus.full_text_search": "true"})
```

When a search has both an embedding and a `query_string`, Feast runs a hybrid search: a vector
search plus one BM25 search per full-text field, combined by the `hybrid_ranker`. With the
`weighted` ranker, `weights` lists the vector search first, then each full-text field.

```python
store.retrieve_online_documents_v2(
    features=["documents:embedding", "documents:body"],
    query=query_embedding,
    query_string="late delivery",
    top_k=10,
    distance_metric="COSINE",  # must match the vector index metric
)
```

Full-text search requires pymilvus 2.5 or later and a Milvus version with BM25 support
(Milvus 2.5+, Zilliz Cloud, or Milvus Lite).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Full-text search only applies to collections created while `full_text_search` is enabled. For
existing collections Feast logs a warning and keeps using `LIKE` filters. To switch, run
`feast teardown` and `feast apply`, then materialize again.
{% endhint %}

## Partition key

A [partition key](https://milvus.io/docs/use-partition-key.md) makes Milvus group rows by the key's
value, so searches filtered on it only scan the matching partitions. This suits multi-tenant data,
such as a catalogue shared by many brands.

Set the partition key per feature view with the `milvus.partition_key` tag:

```python
products = FeatureView(
    name="products",
    entities=[product],
    schema=[
        Field(name="product_id", dtype=Int64),
        Field(name="brand_id", dtype=String),
        Field(name="embedding", dtype=Array(Float32), vector_index=True),
        Field(name="title", dtype=String),
    ],
    source=products_source,
    tags={"milvus.partition_key": "brand_id"},
)
```

or for every feature view that has the field, with `partition_key: brand_id` in the online store
config. The tag takes precedence. Then filter on the key when retrieving:

```python
store.retrieve_online_documents_v2(
    features=["products:embedding", "products:title"],
    query=query_embedding,
    top_k=10,
    filters=ComparisonFilter(type="eq", key="brand_id", value="acme"),
)
```

The partition key field must be stored as `VARCHAR` or `INT64`. String fields are always `VARCHAR`,
and integer fields are `VARCHAR` unless native numeric types are enabled, in which case `Int64` works
and `Int32` does not.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The partition key only applies when Feast creates a collection. Existing collections are not
changed; Feast logs a warning for them. To add a partition key to an existing feature view, run
`feast teardown` and `feast apply`, then materialize again.
{% endhint %}

## Numeric types

By default, numeric and bool features are stored as `VARCHAR`, so range filters (`gt`, `gte`, `lt`,
`lte`) compare strings: `"9" > "100"` is true. Set `native_numeric_types: true` to store them as
native Milvus `INT32`, `INT64`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE` and `BOOL` fields, which compare numerically.
`enable_openai_compatible_store: true` has the same effect.

The setting only applies when Feast creates a collection. Feast detects the storage type of each
existing collection, so reads and writes keep working whichever way the collection was created.
To migrate an existing feature view:

1. Set `native_numeric_types: true`.
2. Run `feast teardown` to drop the collections, then `feast apply` to recreate them.
3. Materialize again to reload the data.

Until a collection is recreated, Feast logs a warning when numeric range filters are used on it.

## Consistency level

By default Milvus uses `Bounded` consistency, so a read issued straight after materialization may
not see the newest writes for a short time. Set `consistency_level: Strong` if reads must always see
the latest writes, at the cost of higher read latency. See the
[Milvus consistency documentation](https://milvus.io/docs/consistency.md).

## Collection loading

Feast creates collections together with their indexes, which makes Milvus load them straight away.
When Feast finds an existing collection it checks its load state and loads it only if needed.
Reads and searches never load collections, so a collection released outside Feast is only reloaded
the next time a Feast process first accesses it.

## Feature views without vectors

Milvus requires every collection to have a vector field. For feature views that have no vector
feature, Feast adds a 2-dimensional `_placeholder_vector` field with a FLAT index and fills it with zeros.
It is never returned or searched.
